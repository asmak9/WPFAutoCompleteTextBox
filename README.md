# WPF: Auto Complete/Suggstion Text Box
By Default WPF pre-install text box control does not come with an auto complete/suggestion feature. There are many 3rd party libraries out there which provide auto complete/suggestion feature for default WPF text box control. Most of these libraries are available in paid version and those which are open-sources are difficult to get integrated with your existing code. So, I have created a very simple **Auto Complete/Suggestion** control for WPF without using any external library. You can easily integrate my control in your project.
